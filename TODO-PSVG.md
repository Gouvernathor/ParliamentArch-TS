- move seat attribution (after seat ordering through the angle) to the main psvg module
- maybe don't put it in the svg module, leaving it in the main module
  - if so, do the same thing to parliamentarch (incompatible API change)
- in consequence, move the Parliament type away from the geometry module
- align and rationalize input formats (objects or maps or lists of pairs ?) consistently with parliamentarch
- consider breaking up parliamentarch's geometry module into subfunctions like psvg's current one
